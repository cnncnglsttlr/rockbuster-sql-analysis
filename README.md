# Rockbuster SQL Analysis Project

This repository showcases the SQL analysis conducted as part of the Rockbuster Stealth LLC case study. The goal was to derive key business insights using structured queries.

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company. The company wants to transition into the online video rental market and better understand customer behavior, top-performing content, and regional performance.

The project was completed as part of the Data Analytics Program at CareerFoundry.

## Key Business Questions Addressed
- Which movies generate the most revenue?
- What are the most common customer locations?
- Do longer movies get rented more often?
- How do film pricing and genre affect rentals?

## SQL Queries
All final SQL queries are provided in a dedicated `.sql` file.  
Each query is documented with its **Analysis Title** (matching the original Excel workbook) and comments.

## Tableau Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize the insights:
